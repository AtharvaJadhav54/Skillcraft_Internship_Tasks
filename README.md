Each `Task X` folder includes:
- `main.py` (or equivalent) — full end-to-end code  
- input data or instructions to download it  
- output artifacts (plots, CSVs, models)  
- `README.md` with detailed steps, results, and usage

## 🚀 How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtharvaJadhav54/Skillcraft_Internship_Tasks.git
   cd Skillcraft_Internship_Tasks
Navigate to a task folder

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Task\ 1    # or Task 2, Task 3, Task 4
Install dependencies
Each task has its own requirements.txt (or a list in its README). Common libraries include:

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

tensorflow, keras (for Task 4)

kagglehub (for dataset download)

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Review outputs

Data cleaning logs

Model metrics (R², RMSE, accuracy, etc.)

Visualizations (scatter plots, confusion matrices)

Saved models or CSVs

✨ Highlights & Learning Outcomes
Task 1: Linear regression pipeline in Colab, interactive upload, feature engineering, Plotly visualizations.

Task 2: K-means clustering, Elbow & Silhouette analysis, segmentation insights for marketing.

Task 3: SVM image classifier on cats vs. dogs, raw pixel flattening, performance metrics.

Task 4: Transfer-learning with MobileNetV2 for hand gestures, data restructuring, fine-tuning, 99% accuracy.
